Hello Youtube, Twitch, and Picarto. 
My Name is Jason, and this is Lineware.
Sure has been a long time, since that
was said.  I have been on a hiatus for
some time and I have finally returned.

Today we will be undertaking the task
of learning how to plan an application.

Our end goal will be building a Tic Tac 
Toe Game in the Python Programming 
Language.

This course will go through many different
concepts and get you started in the most
basic concepts in game development.

The goals of the course are:
1. Creating an App with a graphical 
        Interface    
2. Learning about event Handling
3. Learn to work in a Group
4. Learn the different phases in 
        application development
5. And Much Much More

First thing we need to do is Determine
the rules of tic tac toe.

After a quick lookup on google apparently
the official rules are as follows.

RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE

1. The game is played on a grid that's 
    3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your friend (or the computer 
    in this case) is O. Players take turns 
    putting their marks in empty squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks 
    in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) 
    is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game 
    is over. If no player has 3 marks in 
    a row, the game ends in a tie.
